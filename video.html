            <h4 class="cov">Course Overview</h4>
                    <p>HTML is a relatively easy programming language to learn, which makes it a great place for kids to start with coding in general or as another language to add to their repertoire. 
                        There’s no fixed number of how many HTML tags exist. Based on the web development program being used, however, that number usually lies between 80 and 150. 
                        Many tags that are available in HTML go unused even by professional developers, so it’s easy for kids to learn the most used tags. <br><br>
                        This is why HTML is a fantastic skill for elementary and middle school-aged children to learn. 
                        Even learning such a small language will build their confidence, elevate their interest in learning harder programming languages, and set them up for early success. 
                        It takes little time to teach and memorize HTML code – which leaves plenty of room for more educational opportunities. Our course is tailored for early learning and development focusing on their programming skills. 
                        CEL believes that these are the best learning methods for this age group involving gadgets and videos.</p>
