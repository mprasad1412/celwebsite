            <h4 class="cov">Course Overview</h4>
                    <p>Science is a relatively interesting subject to learn, which makes it a great place for kids to start with basic/general Science to add to their repertoire. 
                        Science helps children develop key life skills, including an ability to communicate, remain organized and focused, and even form their own opinions based on observation. Science also helps children develop their senses and overall awareness.<br><br>
                        This is why Science is an important for elementary and middle school-aged children to learn. 
                        Our course is tailored for early learning and development focusing on scientific skills such as observing, how to communicate effectively, as well as the scientific principles of investigation and experimentation.
                        CEL believes that these are the best learning methods for this age group involving gadgets and videos.</p>
